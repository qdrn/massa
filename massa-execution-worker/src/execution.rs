//! This module deals with executing final and active slots, as well as read-only requests.
//! It also keeps a history of executed slots, thus holding the speculative state of the ledger.
//!
//! Execution usually happens in the following way:
//! * an execution context is set up
//! * the VM is called for execution within this context
//! * the output of the execution is extracted from the context
