//! # General description
//!
//! This crate implements a ledger matching addresses to balances, executable bytecode and data.
//! It also provides tools to manipulate ledger entries.
//!
//! FinalLedger representing a ledger at a given slot that was executed as final
//! (see the massa-execution-worker crate for details on execution).
//! Only the execution worker writes into the final ledger.
//!
//! # A note on parallel vs sequential balance
//!
//! The distinctions between the parallel and the sequential balance of a ledger entry are the following:
//! * the parallel balance can be credited or spent in any slot
//! * the sequential balance can be credited in any slot but only spent in slots form the address' thread
//! * block produers are credited fees from the sequential balance,
//!   and they can ensure that this balance will be available for their block simply
//!   by looking for sequential balance spendings within the block's thread.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ## ledger.rs
//! Defines the FinalLedger that matches an address to a LedgerEntry (see ledger_entry.rs),
//! and can be manipulated using LedgerChanges (see ledger_changes.rs).
//! The FinalLedger is bootstrapped using tooling available in bootstrap.rs
//!
//! ## ledger_entry.rs
//! Represents an entry in the ledger for a given address.
//! It contains balances, executable bytecode and an arbitrary datastore.
//!
//! ## ledger_changes.rs
//! Represents a list of changes to ledger entries that
//! can be modified, combined or applied to the final ledger.
//!
//! ## bootstrap.rs
//! Provides serializable strucutres and tools for bootstrapping the final ledger.  
//!
//! ## Test exports
//!
//! When the crate feature `testing` is enabled, tooling useful for testing purposes is exported.
//! See test_exports/mod.rs for details.
